        <h3>Description: </h3>
        <p> This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. 
            Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>What you will need are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
           <li> <strong>Step 1</strong> In a large bowl, sift together the flour, 
                baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, 
                egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
           
           <li> <strong>Step 2</strong> Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. 
                Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. 
                Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Notes:</h3>
             <p>The salt amount has been reduced based on review feedback. 
                Original recipe called for 1 teaspoon.</p>
